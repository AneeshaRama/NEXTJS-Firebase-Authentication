## **Authentication system using NextJS and Firebase**

This mini project has user authentication functionalities like registering new user and signing in existing user.

I have used **NextJS**(production ready react framework) in frontend, google **firebase** for handling authentication, **TailwindCSS** and **MaterialUI** for styling and to make web application **responsive** 

### Google Firebase

Google Firebase is a Google-backed application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android and Web apps. 
It provides lots of features like handling authentication, realtime database, storage facility, hosting and many more..
Talking about authentication, it provides multiple ways to authenticate users like using email and password, using social media accounts like facebook, github etc, it also provides features like passwordless authentication using email.
But in this project I have only used authenticating user by email and password.
When user registers with email and password, firebase generates access token and send it to the client and save the user information.

I have used modern tools like **TailwindCSS** and **MaterialUI** for styling and making website responsive.
